Only Four parameters need to be controlled in these 8 sequence files: 

1. is_analog % show digital or analog sequence

2. version
% version=1 representing sequence is nonadaptive without prior, version=3 representing sequence is adaptive without prior, 
% version=19 representing sequence is nonadaptive with prior, version=39 representing sequence is adaptive with prior

3. start_ctrl_seqs; % this is a_0, step size

4. SD_coeff; % this is c, standard deviation of RM distribution
