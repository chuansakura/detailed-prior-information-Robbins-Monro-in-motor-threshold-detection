This whole project includes the files to implement the 8 different sequences to estimate the motor threshold.
This file should be implemented in MATLAB.

Do not edit all the MATLAB function files. 

Unzip 'Subjects_25000_reprocessed.zip' in the current folder before use!!!!

I used the sequence name as MATLAB files name to show which method is implemented in the corresponding file,
including run_ACS.m, run_ACSPI.m, run_ACSA.m, run_ACSAPI.m,run_DCS.m, run_DCSPI.m, run_DCSA.m, run_DCSAPI.m.

In each file, a random patient is picked. 
Then, this type of sequence is implemented once and the threshold estimation deviation is recorded.
